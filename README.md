# Philosophers

## Description
The Philosophers project simulates the classic "Dining Philosophers" problem. This problem involves a number of philosophers who alternate between thinking, eating, and sleeping. The challenge is managing shared resources (forks) so that philosophers donâ€™t starve, taking care to avoid data races.

This project was designed to help students learn the basics of multithreading, mutexes, and process synchronization.

## Features
- **Multithreaded Philosopher Simulation**: Each philosopher runs in a separate thread or process.
- **Resource Sharing**: Each philosopher must acquire two forks to eat, simulating resource sharing among concurrent processes.
- **Thread Safety with Mutexes**: Prevents simultaneous access to forks using mutexes.
- **Time Management**: Each philosopher has designated times for eating, thinking, and sleeping.

## Compilation and Usage
Compile the project using the Makefile included. The executable `philo` is generated for the mandatory part, and `philo_bonus` for the bonus.

### Compile
To compile, simply run:
```bash
make
```

### Run
```bash
./philo <number_of_philosophers> <time_to_die> <time_to_eat> <time_to_sleep> [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]
```
**Arguments**:
1. `number_of_philosophers`: Total number of philosophers and forks.
2. `time_to_die`: Time (in ms) before a philosopher dies if they don't start eating.
3. `time_to_eat`: Time (in ms) a philosopher takes to eat.
4. `time_to_sleep`: Time (in ms) a philosopher takes to sleep.
5. `number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat` (optional): Simulation stops if each philosopher eats this many times.

## Project Structure
- **`philo/`**: Contains mandatory project source code.
- **`philo_bonus/`**: Contains the bonus part implementation with additional requirements.

## Example
```bash
./philo 5 800 200 200
```

## Simulation Output
Logs each state change of a philosopher in the format:
```
<timestamp> <philosopher_number> has taken a fork
<timestamp> <philosopher_number> is eating
<timestamp> <philosopher_number> is sleeping
<timestamp> <philosopher_number> is thinking
<timestamp> <philosopher_number> died
```
